		History.<br>
		<br>2017<br>
        <code>PHP DevelStudio</code> was the first "IDE" where i started to learn programming
		<br>That "IDE" used PHP as a programming language
		<br>The first time when I heard about <code>PHP DevelStudio</code> it was like the beginning of the 2017
		<br>Seeing how easy it is to create a program (which can, however, be easily decompiled)
		<br>I was thinking to create a few programs
		<br>I forgot about <code>PHP DevelStudio</code> until November 2017, then i decompliled the first program
		<br>On 1st December 2017, I was thinking of creating a launcher, and i made a few updates and gave it up(I gave up, because I wanted to improve the user interace and the code)
		
		<br>
		<br>
		The rising.<br>
		<br>2018<br>
		
		<br>In the beginning of 2018 like January, I created <code>Calculator</code>, <code>Task Manager</code> (that can only kill process though), <code>Base64 Encoder/Decoder</code>, and i've created <code>Unlocker</code>
		<br>In the summer of 2018, I created the first decompiler <code>VDecompiler</code> that decompiles basic sections
		<br>In the autumn of 2018, I created another decompiler, but he could decompile Protectors, except for specific
		<br>In the middle of autumn 2018, I created <code>VDecompiler 2.0</code> and I learned a lot about DevelStudio Protection (Loader: A seperate file/section of program where the events/configs/forms load, and knowing how and where they decode you can get the code, How to get code of program without a decompiler or injector: Hook does a lot, How the injector gets code: While injected program is running, it replaces php5ts.dll original to php5ts.dll injected, after this the injected dll begins to hook as much as possible code, but there's a possibility to protect the program e.g check the checksum of dll)
		<br>In October 2018, I created "obfuscator" program that was replacing strings to "IIIIIII", or "OOOOOOOO", "eval(base64_decode("
		<br>At the end of 2018, I created "useless" the program that was used to test something (I can't recall)
		<br>It was the end of 2018, I was thinking what to create, and it was <code>TrashLauncher 2.0</code> (i still didn't know how to write a program completely and took a lot from the internet)
		
		<br>
		<br>
		The start to falling.<br>
		<br>2019<br>
		
		<br>Can't say what happened at the beginning of 2019
		<br>In the summer of 2019, I've created TrashLauncher 2.0, but it had many bugs, and its protection wasn't good
		<br>In the end of 2019, and as always i've created <code>TrashLauncher 2.0</code> (I don't know what for I created it then)
		
		<br>
		<br>
		The Fall.<br>
		<br>2020<br>
		<br>Since 2020, i have figured out how to decompile any program that was made by <code>PHP DevelStudio</code>
		<br>The year when i decided to leave <code>PHP DevelStudio</code> compelety, because the community switched to <code>DevelNext</code> or switched to another programming language
		<br>And then i've learned Java, so i can write programs on Java
		<br>In the end of 2020, i've created <code>TrashLauncher 2.0</code> (UPD: There's a new launcher called <code>TrashLauncher 2.0</code> written using C# + C++, the current one won't be rewritten)
		<br>
		
		<br>
		<br>
		Postscript.<br>
		<br>2021<br>
		<br>By this time, DevelStudio is useless program without future
		<br>A lot had changed before this
		<br>The same relates to DevelNext

        History.<br>
		<br>
		
		2018
		<br>I tried <code>DevelNext</code> in January 2018, as usual i didn't know how to write more complex program than hello world (lol)
		<br>For sure, <code>DevelNext</code> is definitely better than <code>PHP DevelStudio</code> at compiling the classes to bytecode thereby making it almost impossible to decompile the code (There was one decompiler, but he doesn't work since <code>DevelNext</code> added protection)
		<br>In spring 2018, i've created <code>Calculator 2.0</code> with a new interface and he supported cross-platform running (you could run him on Windows, Linux, MacOS)
		<br>In summer 2018 or so, i've learned a lot about <code>DevelNext</code> (History: When was DevelNext created, Syntax: After all, i didn't like the syntax, Protection: You need to be a good re-engineer to dissassemble any program written in DevelNext, Compiling: Nothing special, the compiler during the compilation builds every file to .jar, then it "obfuscates" the program, Ui: Not gonna lie, You can create a nice UI with a modern look, but then we would be faced with high memory usage, it's still Java with a different wrapper)
		<br>The following is not without <code>TrashLauncher</code> that was created on DevelNext with a new dark interface and good protection from decompilers
		<br>TrashLauncher existed until the end of 2018

		<br>
		<br>2021
		<br>
		<br>On January, 2021, i was thinking of redesigning the launcher, because he looked like a program from 2000-2009 and the launcher was complelety written on Java (As a result of this: Terrible performance, memory consumption, non-native look, laggy JVM, need to have Java, Garbage collection that can't be used manually, etc...)
		<br>So i thought it would be better to rewrite the launcher, i started to rewrite the whole launcher from the scratch
		<br>With this language i have created TrashLauncher 2.0 with a dark theme and user-friendly GUI, it became a good idea tbh
		<br>When i changed Java to C#, i managed to make a modern interface (After this Swing was garbage to me)
